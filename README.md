# DeepMind - Image-based Mood Analyzer

This project is a web application that allows you to upload an image representing your current mood. It uses Google Gemini's artificial intelligence to analyze the image and provide a brief psychological reflection.

## How It Works

1.  **Frontend (React)**: A clean and modern interface allows you to select and preview an image from your device. It supports both light and dark modes, and English/Spanish languages.
2.  **AI Analysis (Google Gemini)**: The image is sent to an AI backend with a specific prompt to interpret its visual elements from a psychological perspective.
3.  **Result**: The application displays the interpretation generated by the AI, giving you a new perspective on your mood.

## Publishing to GitHub & API Key Security

### :warning: CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING :warning:
**NEVER commit your API key to a public GitHub repository.**

The project is designed to be run in two ways: locally for development and connected to a backend (like n8n) for production/public deployment.

- **For local development**, you can temporarily add your API key in `index.html` as instructed below, but **NEVER** save or commit this file with the key in it.
- **For the live version on GitHub Pages**, you **MUST** use a secure backend method like the n8n workflow described in "Option 2". This keeps your API key safe and private.

## Option 1: Run Locally with Direct API Connection

This method is for **local development and testing only**.

### Requirements

*   A modern web browser.
*   A Google Gemini API key. You can get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Steps to Run Locally

1.  **Temporarily Configure API Key**: 
    *   Open the `index.html` file.
    *   Before the closing `</body>` tag, add the following script, replacing `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual key.
        ```html
        <script>
          // FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY! DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE WITH THE KEY.
          window.process = {
            env: {
              API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'
            }
          };
        </script>
        ```
2.  **Open the Application**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3.  **Remove Key Before Committing**: Before you ever run `git add .` or `git commit`, make sure you have **removed the script block** with your API key from `index.html`.

## Option 2: Secure Production Integration with n8n

This is the **recommended and secure** way to run the application publicly on GitHub Pages.

### 1. Host n8n for Free

The easiest way to get started with n8n for free is by using their cloud service.

*   **n8n Cloud**: Visit [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/) and sign up for their "Starter" plan. They offer a free tier that is sufficient for this project. They will give you a URL for your n8n instance (e.g., `https://your-name.n8n.cloud`).

### 2. Create the Workflow in n8n

In your n8n instance, create a new workflow with two nodes:

**Node 1: Webhook (The Trigger)**
*   Create a "Webhook" node.
*   **Authentication**: `None`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Respond**: `When last node finishes`.
*   Copy the **Production URL**. You will need this for the React app.

**Node 2: Google Gemini (The Analyzer)**
*   Add a "Google Gemini" node.
*   **Authentication**: Connect your Google account or use "API Key". Paste your Gemini API key here. It is now secure within n8n.
*   **Resource**: `Multimodal Content`
*   **Operation**: `Generate Content`
*   In the **Text** field, paste the prompt from the `translations.ts` file (either English or Spanish, or create logic in your workflow to handle both).
*   For the **Input Data** field, use an expression to get the image from the webhook: `{{ $binary.data }}`.

### 3. Modify the Frontend Code

Modify the `services/geminiService.ts` file to call your n8n webhook URL instead of the Gemini API directly. This involves changing the `fetch` call to point to your new n8n production URL.
