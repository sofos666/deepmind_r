# DeepMind - Image-based Mood Analyzer

This project is a web application that allows you to upload an image representing your current mood. It uses Google Gemini's artificial intelligence to analyze the image and provide a brief psychological reflection.

## How It Works

1.  **Frontend (React)**: A clean and modern interface allows you to select and preview an image from your device. It supports both light and dark modes, and English/Spanish languages.
2.  **AI Analysis (Google Gemini)**: The image is sent to the Gemini API with a specific prompt to interpret its visual elements from a psychological perspective.
3.  **Result**: The application displays the interpretation generated by the AI, giving you a new perspective on your mood.

## Publishing to GitHub & API Key Security

### :warning: IMPORTANT NOTE ON API KEYS :warning:
The project is designed to be run locally or deployed. For public deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages), it's highly recommended to use a secure backend proxy to protect your API key, as described in "Option 2". The local development method described below is safe for development but should not be used for a public-facing website where the key could be exposed in browser network requests.

## Option 1: Run Locally with a Secure API Key Setup

This method is for **local development and testing only**. It uses a method that prevents you from accidentally committing your API key.

### Requirements

*   A modern web browser.
*   A Google Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Steps to Run Locally

1.  **Create a `local.js` file**:
    *   Find the file named `local.example.js` in the project folder.
    *   Make a copy of this file and rename it to `local.js`.

2.  **Configure Your API Key**:
    *   Open your new `local.js` file.
    *   Replace the placeholder `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual key and save the file.

3.  **Open the Application**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. The app will automatically load your key from `local.js`.

:lock: **How is this secure for development?** The `local.js` file is listed in the `.gitignore` file. This tells Git to *never* track this file or include it in your commits, keeping your API key safe on your local machine and off of GitHub.

## Option 2: Secure Production Integration with n8n

This is the **recommended and secure** way to run the application publicly (e.g., on GitHub Pages). This method uses a backend service (n8n) to act as a proxy, hiding your API key from the frontend code.

### 1. Host n8n for Free

The easiest way to get started with n8n for free is by using their cloud service.

*   **n8n Cloud**: Visit [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/) and sign up. They have a free tier that is sufficient for this project. They will give you a URL for your n8n instance (e.g., `https://your-name.n8n.cloud`).

### 2. Create the Workflow in n8n

In your n8n instance, create a new workflow with two nodes:

**Node 1: Webhook (The Trigger)**
*   Create a "Webhook" node.
*   **Authentication**: `None`
*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`
*   **Respond**: `When last node finishes`.
*   Copy the **Production URL**. You will need this for the React app.

**Node 2: Google Gemini (The Analyzer)**
*   Add a "Google Gemini" node.
*   **Authentication**: Connect your Google account or use "API Key". Paste your Gemini API key here. It is now secure within n8n.
*   **Resource**: `Multimodal Content`
*   **Operation**: `Generate Content`
*   In the **Text** field, paste the prompt from the `translations.ts` file (either English or Spanish).
*   For the **Input Data** field, use an expression to get the image from the webhook: `{{ $binary.data }}`.

### 3. Modify the Frontend Code

To use your new n8n backend, you would modify the `services/geminiService.ts` file to `fetch` from your n8n webhook URL instead of calling the Gemini API directly. This part is left as an exercise for the user, as it involves changing the core API call logic.# deepmind
